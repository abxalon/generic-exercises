<!--This is fizzbuzz, the problem statement:
Write a program that takes a userâ€™s input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. 
However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz-->

    <script>
        // First, I'll declare a variable with the input of the user as value
        let theNumber = parseInt(prompt("Give me a number, any number"));
        
        //pretty straightforward, the "for" statement declares the variable "increment"
        //and creates loop that repeats until the condition in the second part is met.
        //if the condition is not met, then the variable "increment" is... incremented by 1
        //which is the value of "increment", this works with 2, 3, etc.
        //The if statement checks via modulo if the value of "increment" is exactly divisible
        //by three, if this condition is met, the console logs "Fizz" instead of the number.
        for (let increment = 1; increment <= theNumber; increment++){
            if(increment % 3 === 0 && increment % 5 ===0) {
